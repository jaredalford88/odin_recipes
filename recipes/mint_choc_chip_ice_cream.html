    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        This mint chocolate chip ice cream is made in an ice cream maker with
        milk, cream, sugar, peppermint extract, and lots of chocolate chips. I
        discovered using 2% milk in the recipe makes the ice cream taste lighter.
        Super refreshing on a hot summer day!
