    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
          Combine graham cracker crumbs and sugar in a bowl; add melted butter.
          Mix until evenly moistened; press into the bottom and sides of a 9-inch
          pie plate. Bake in the preheated oven until crust begins to brown, about
          10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes.

        <li>
          Whisk sweetened condensed milk, lime juice, and sour cream together in a
          large bowl until combined; stir in lime zest. Pour filling into crust.
          Bake until tiny bubbles begin to form on surface of pie, 7 to 10
          minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack.
        </li>
        <li>
          Beat heavy cream, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla extract in a chilled
          glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until stiff.
